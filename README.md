# 🎮 Gemini — Physics-Based Platformer

Welcome to Gemini, a unique platformer game where the challenge lies not in navigating the environment, but in mastering the physics that govern it. Each level introduces a new physical law that players must adapt to, creating innovative gameplay mechanics and mind-bending puzzles.

> 💡 Imagine jumping on the moon, or trying to move without friction - Gemini challenges you to think outside the box!
